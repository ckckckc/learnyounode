  Node will first look in the core modules and then in the node_modules directory where the package is located.

The http.get() method is a shortcut for simple GET requests, use it to  
simplify your solution. The first argument to http.get() can be the URL  
you want to GET; provide a callback as the second argument.  

Unlike other callback functions, this one has the signature:  

  function callback (response) { /* ... */ }  

Where the response object is a Node Stream object. 
You can treat Node Streams as objects that emit events. 
The three events that are of most interest are: "data", "error" and "end".
